        <h2 class="text-center text-light pt-4">The methods behind the madness</h2>

        <p class="pt-4">In 2010 I scored a cheap Canon point and shoot camera. I seldom used it nor had did I have any clue about how to use it. A few years later, I remembered that I had an unused camera and for some unknown reason, I decided to get it out and started taking pictures of random shit. My pictures really sucked (some people still think they do). What was I supposed to take pictures of flowers, sunsets, or landscapes? I didn’t have any basis or understanding of photo fundamentals like subject, composition, or depth of field. </p>

        <p>A few years later, I was going to school in Portland, and I got the bright idea to take a photography class. Photography was never something I thought I would be into, but felt it would be a good growing experience for me. On the first day of class it was very apparent that I was the inexperienced one, and I felt very out-of-place. My classmates all seemed to be very knowledgeable about photography and famous photographers that I had never heard of. At the beginning of the second week everyone brought their cameras to class, and to my surprise my classmates all had really nice DSLR cameras and there I was with my little point and shoot, but I didn’t let my feelings get the best of me and remained in the class.</p>

        <p>I don’t know if it was me or if my class was made up of elitist, art snobs, nobody really talked to me. I didn’t have the same level of experience as the class did, I never really used a camera much , and I had not used photo editing software either. The photography learning curve was extremely steep, and it was somewhat disappointing for me. When it came time to show our pictures, I was nervous and didn’t want to let anyone see mine. My images where put on the projector and poorly received week after week. I was staring to get pissed off, but decided to use my anger as fuel to push myself harder and learn to use my cheap camera and take better pictures than my “artsy” classmates. At that moment Art of Spite was born. I pushed on reading and studying all kinds of photography tutorials. I would practice taking pictures daily. By the end of the term my work was on par with my classmates and their expensive cameras..</p>

        <p>Since that first class, I have purchased a couple of fairly expensive cameras and lenses, that have really helped improve my photos. The little Canon finally broke, and I have really missed having a camera that fit in my pocket and was easy to carry around everywhere. My determination payed off, I have now had the privilege of displaying stuff in a couple of galleries, and I have had my own showing of a group of photos I took. To my surprise, people have even bought a few from me. What I have enjoyed the most has been helping other people learn how to use a camera and edit their images, but what gives me the most joy is watching someone that I have been working with find their eye and develop a style that is unique to them. I have become lazy over the last couple of years and have resorted to using an iPhone instead of my camera to shoot with. The phone is compact, easy to carry around, and works great for Instagram pictures. I plan on packing my camera around more this Winter and getting some great shots while I'm in Pittsburgh or traveling around the rust belt..</p>
